### Hello Dear Friends  👋✨
I am Abdurrezzak, a new student in programming. The motive that made me choose this field is that I have a passion for technology and programming, and I also plan to study software engineering in the future.

Now I am learning the **Python** programming language, and also learning about **Git** and **GitHub**.

Wish me luck guys, thank you all ❤✨
